# Heart Disease Risk Prediction

This project predicts the risk of heart disease using a machine learning pipeline with logistic regression and decision trees. SHAP is used for interpretability.

## Features

- Data preprocessing with one-hot encoding and scaling
- Training using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models
- SHAP-based explainability
- Reproducible and modular code
- Ready for PhysioNet or academic publication

## Usage

pip install -r requirements.txt
Then run:

preprocess.py to load and process data

model.py to train and evaluate models

explain.py to visualize SHAP-based explanations
